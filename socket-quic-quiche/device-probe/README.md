# Android handoff-probe rig

Hand-driven, multi-day runs of `DeviceHandoffProbe` on a real phone against the public echo server.
Everything here talks to the phone through `adb`; the probe itself runs detached and survives unplugging.

## Before a run (phone plugged in and UNLOCKED)

```bash
./gradlew :socket-quic-quiche:assembleDebugAndroidTest     # from the repo root; needs rustup's cargo + JDK 21
device-probe/pull.sh previous-run          # START truncates the on-device log — save the old one first
device-probe/install.sh                    # proves the APK on the phone by sha256
device-probe/doze.sh                       # Doze / App Standby exemption
device-probe/preflight.sh                  # Tailscale OFF, route, install, notifications, whitelist, battery
```

## Dry run (about 15 minutes)

```bash
device-probe/start.sh 20 400 250           # minutes, read deadline ms, echo cadence ms
device-probe/toggle.sh 2 45                # wifi off/on + airplane on/off, twice
device-probe/dryrun-doze.sh 180            # 3 minutes of forced deep idle (a hotel night)
device-probe/status.sh
```

Pass: `migrated` rises on each Wi-Fi toggle, `dead` rises once per airplane window and `attempts`
shows the backed-off reconnects, `broken` stays 0, echoes keep flowing through the idle window,
and the `HEARTBEAT` RSS goes up and *down* (a sawtooth, not a ramp).

## The real run

```bash
device-probe/start.sh 4500 400 250         # 75 hours
device-probe/status.sh                     # then unplug; the probe keeps going
```

Keep the phone charging whenever possible (Doze never starts on power) and Tailscale off (with it
on there is nothing to migrate). Airplane mode is fine: the probe backs off to one attempt a minute
and reconnects when a route returns.

## After the run

```bash
device-probe/pull.sh walk
device-probe/analyze.py device-probe/logs/<stamp>-walk.log
```

The analyzer prints every connection and why it ended, every migration and how long it took, the
echo gaps, RTT percentiles, the memory trend, and every `STREAM-INTEGRITY-BROKEN` /
`CONNECTION-DEAD` line verbatim. Those last two are the lines that turn into issues.
