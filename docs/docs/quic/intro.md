# QUIC

`socket-quic` is a sister artifact that adds a QUIC (RFC 9000) client and server with the same
scope-based, suspend-based shape as the core `socket` module — and the same zero-copy buffer
discipline. It lives in a separate dependency so TCP-only consumers don't pay for it.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.ditchoom:socket-quic:<latest-version>")
}
```

## Why QUIC?

- **Multiplexed streams** — many independent bidirectional/unidirectional streams over one
  connection, with no head-of-line blocking between them.
- **Always encrypted** — TLS 1.3 is built into the handshake; there is no plaintext QUIC.
- **Unreliable datagrams** (RFC 9221) — fire-and-forget messages alongside reliable streams.
- **Connection migration** (RFC 9000 §9) — survive a local address change without a new handshake.
- **Same API everywhere** — one Kotlin codebase across JVM, Android, Linux native, and Apple.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Backend | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| JVM / Android | [quiche](https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche) | FFM on JDK 21+, JNI on JDK ≤20 |
| Linux (x64/arm64) | quiche cinterop | Static `libquiche.a`, io_uring UDP |
| Apple (iOS/macOS/…) | quiche cinterop | Client UDP over `NWConnection` (path-migration aware), server on a dual-stack POSIX UDP socket |
| JS / wasmJs | — | Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` (no raw UDP) |

## The Shape of the API

Everything runs inside a scope that owns the connection's lifetime. The handshake completes before
your block runs, and the connection closes when the block exits — on normal return, exception, or
cancellation.

```kotlin
withQuicConnection("example.com", 443, QuicOptions(alpnProtocols = listOf("h3"))) {
    // `this` is a QuicScope — open streams, send datagrams, migrate paths…
    val stream = openStream()
    // …
    stream.close()
} // connection closed here
```

`QuicOptions.alpnProtocols` is the one required field — QUIC always negotiates an application
protocol during the TLS handshake.

## Who closes what

The **connection scope is the resource boundary.** When the block exits, the connection — and every
stream opened on it — is torn down, so a stream you forget to close is reclaimed, not leaked. You
still call `stream.close()` / `shutdownSend()` to send the peer a prompt FIN, and to release streams
as you finish them in a **long-lived** connection that opens many.

**Buffers are the exception** — they aren't owned by the scope, so always pair an allocation with
`use { }` (it frees even if the body throws). Allocate from the scope's own `bufferFactory` rather
than a global, so your buffers match the connection's allocation strategy:

```kotlin
withQuicConnection("example.com", 443, QuicOptions(alpnProtocols = listOf("h3"))) {
    bufferFactory.allocate(11).use { out ->  // `bufferFactory` is a QuicScope member
        out.writeString("hello quic!", Charset.UTF8)
        out.resetForRead()
        openStream().write(out)
    }
}
```

`bufferFactory` defaults to [`BufferFactory.network()`](./connection#buffers-bufferfactorynetwork) —
the native-memory factory QUIC needs — unless you override `ConnectionOptions.bufferFactory`.

## Next Steps

- [Connections & Streams](./connection) — client, server, the `QuicByteStream` lifecycle, and datagrams
- [Typed Stream Multiplexing](./stream-mux) — exchange codec-typed messages with `withQuicMux`
- [Trace Capture & Retrace](./trace-capture) — record a connection's packet-level trace and deobfuscate it
- [HTTP/3 & WebTransport](../http3/intro) — the `socket-http3` layer built on top of QUIC
